## Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

At moment I'm working with:

- **SASS/CSS**
- **JS/React**
- **JSP**

 I'm an Web Developer and Iâ€™m currently learning about:
 
- **Atomic Design**
- **Accessibility**
- **Material Design**

I find it easy to do:

- **frontend builds and modules**
- **CSS and your strategies** (components, helpers, structure, resets...)
- **functional programming**

<!--
